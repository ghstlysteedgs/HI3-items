  MosiClickCounter was made by Ghostly Steeds Game Studios, this application does not do anything to the horse isle game. It only reads keybind inputs from your computer.

**MosiClickCounter** is a graphical application designed to keep track of mouse clicks while supering and also has a manual counter for each mutation you super past.

### **Features Overview**
1. **Mouse Click Counter**
2. **Item Tracker**
3. **Control Buttons (Start, Pause, Resume, Stop)**
4. **Save Statistics to File**
5. **Graphical Interface**

### **Feature Details**
#### **1. Mouse Click Counter**
The application continuously monitors mouse clicks when active. This feature is useful for tracking the number of times your mouse is clicked after you hit "Start", displaying how many times you click your mouse while navigating through the game.
- The total **click count** is displayed prominently in the interface.
- The click count updates in real time as you interact.

#### **2. Muti Tracker**
The application includes pre-configured mutation counter for tracking how many times you come across each mutation type. Each mut can be updated individually using **+** and **-** buttons to add or remove counts.
    - `Flash`
    - `Birdcatcher`
    - `Grease`
    - `Mosaic`
    - `Tetrarch`
    - `Lace`

- For each item:
    - Clicking the `+` button increases the count by one.
    - Clicking the `-` button decreases the count by one (cannot go below 0).
    - Real-time updates of item counts are displayed.
    - THIS IS NOT DONE AUTOMATICALLY, THIS APP HAS NO WAY TO READ WHAT HORSE ISLE COMES ACROSS.


#### **3. Control Buttons**
MosiClickCounter includes buttons for controlling the session. These buttons allow you to easily manage the behavior of the program.
##### **Start Button**
- Initializes the application and starts monitoring mouse clicks.
- Resets all counters to zero when the session starts.

##### **Pause/Resume Button**
- Toggles the mouse click tracker between **pause** and **resume** states without resetting the counters.
- When paused, all counting stops but remains open for resumption.

##### **Stop Button**
- Stops the session completely and resets **all counters** to zero, including mouse click counts and item counts.
- A confirmation dialog requires you to confirm before resetting.

#### **4. Save Statistics to File**
Users can export their current click and item statistics to a `.txt` file for documentation or record-keeping purposes.
- **How it works**:
    - Click the "Save Stats" button.
    - This opens a dialog box where you can select where the `.txt` file will be saved.
    - The saved file will include:
        - Total number of mouse clicks.
        - The counts for each muti being tracked.

- **Example Output**:
``` 
  Mouse Clicks: 150

  Item Tracker Stats:
    Flash: 5
    Birdcatcher: 3
    Grease: 0
    Mosaic: 1
